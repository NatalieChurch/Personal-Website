                    Edit text later: I love going on exciting adventures in nature. You might find me outside flipping rocks looking for bugs, smelling flowers, identifying trees, bird-watching, tromping through streams and fields, and tossing snowballs if the weather is right! Anytime I find something new or interesting, I'll always send photos and share with my friends, family, and anybody else who wants to hear!

                    Edit text later: Commonly play Hollow knight, animal crossing, stardew valley. I love almost all genres, and am excited to talk about them! The reason video games have such a spot in my heart is because they can be these amazing interactive works of art that inspire and educate in such a fun way! Some games that do this well include Roki (Help a girl rescue her brother while exploring a world rich with Scandinavian folklore!), Gris (Lead a young woman on a journey to reclaim her lost memories and find peace after loss), When the Past Was Around (Help a woman come to terms with loss and reclaim her passion for music), and Gibbon: Beyond the Trees (Wrestle with the reality of environmental degradation as you control a gibbon navigating your once peaceful habitat and the ruins it became).
